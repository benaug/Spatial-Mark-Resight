# Spatial-Mark-Resight
Various spatial mark resight MCMC samplers in nimble allowing for all sample types including "unknown marked status". Handles known and unknown number of marked individuals and optional telemetry.

This code contains contributions from Glenn Stauffer (though any problems should be blamed on me).

Disclaimer: Code has been tested thoroughly, but I restructured it to better match the other latent ID SCR samplers on my github. I don't think I screwed anything up in the process, but will retest soon.
