# Spatial-Mark-Resight
Various spatial mark resight MCMC samplers allowing for all sample types including "unknown marked status".

This code contains contributions from Glenn Stauffer (though any problems should be blamed on me).

Disclaimer: Code needs to be retested after some structural changes. Should be 100% correct, but I need to do some more simulating.
