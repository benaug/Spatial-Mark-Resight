# Spatial-Mark-Resight
Various spatial mark resight MCMC samplers in nimble allowing for all sample types including "unknown marked status". Handles known and unknown number of marked individuals and optional telemetry.

If you want to use individual ID covariates, there is a different Github project for that: Spatial-Mark-Resight-IDcov.

This code contains contributions from Glenn Stauffer (though any problems should be blamed on me).
